        This document captures requirements to evolve protocol handlers as available on the web. The goal is to
        make it possible to extend the set of protocols that are supported while maintaining a high level of
        security and trust for users.

      <h2>Handlers Beyond Handoff</h2>
      <p>
        Protocol handlers today are focused on single-shot handoff. When activating a <code>mailto:</code> link,
        the browser will either hand it off to the OS for a native application to handle, or will pass it to a
        (top-level) URL that will receive it as a parameter and process it. In either case, the interaction
        is not incorporated into the current context and no further interaction with the protocol is possible.
        In effect, this is more a scheme dispatcher than a comprehensive handler for a given protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today's on-ramp for new protocols to become used on the web beyond a simple handoff however is too steep.
        While there is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9158">interest from implementers in loosening
        handler registration</a>, that does not extend to the ability to fully integrate new protocols into the
        web stack such that they can be the source of top-level documents, iframes, fetch, images, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document captures requirements for browser extensions to be able to register as full-fledged (or
        at least <em>fuller</em>-fledged) programmatic protocol handlers. For instance, using this approach an
        extension could implement support for IPFS directly within any browser context.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Integration</h2>
      <p>
        One goal is that registering a protocol handler in different ways and at different levels should map to
        a unified underlying model to the extent possible, so as to ensure that a single code path controls
        protocol handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        With progress towards a IANA+blocklist approach as advocated in <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9158">whatwg/html#9158</a>,
        there is no need to limit registration to <code>web+</code>- or <code>ext+</code>-prefixed schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed integration method for new protocol handling is to operate a Service Worker for that
        protocol that can respond to <code>FetchEvent</code>s. The assumption is that the browser will
        address any and all schemes with HTTP semantics, and it is up to the handler to figure out the
        appropriate mapping, knowing that there will likely be impendance mismatch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current proposal only exposes this capability to extensions. In that context, registering a
        Service Worker for handling by an extension is done using the
        <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/protocol_handlers">protocol_handlers</a></code>
        field. We suggest adding a <code>serviceWorker</code> field that points to a JS resource in the
        extension implementing a Service Worker. The <code>serviceWorker</code> field takes precedence
        over the <code>uriTemplate</code> field (but having both is not an error, this allows for an
        upgrade path). (See <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/212">notes from lidel
        tracking the idea</a>.) If desirable, this could be extended to
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/protocol_handlers">web app manifests</a>
        as well.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Integration Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        In order to plug a protocol as an extension to the browser's capabilities, we need to address more than
        simply handing a URL off to an API that returns a stream. While it is possible to expose the many
        options involved through an API, it is easy enough to shoot yourself in the foot and has enough potential
        security issues that our preference goes to selecting a strict default behavior instead.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>URL Processing</h2>
        <p>
          URLs integrate deeply into the web stack and specific schemes can have a host (pun intended) of
          different behaviors.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Origins</h2>
          <p>
            In order to integrate into the stack, a new scheme needs to map its URL-space onto origins. However,
            not all schemes have <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> components.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Proposal</strong>. URLs are parsed as per [[url]]. Because the browser cannot guess the default
            port for that scheme, the API is expected to provide it, if it is meaningful.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Credentials</h2>
          <p>
            URLs may have credentials components, and the basic URL parser will parse them if they are present. These
            however can be problematic, what with embedding credentials in plain text and all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Proposal</strong>. The browser parses them but removes them from the URL before calling the Service
            Worker.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Canonicalization</h2>
          <p>
            In HTTP URLs, paths get canonicalized (e.g. <code>..</code> path segments are removed) but that is not the
            case with all schemes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Proposal</strong>. Developer expectations are that these canonicalized are resolved and many resources
            simply assume it. We should canonicalize automatically.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Writability</h2>
        <p>
          Many protocols aren't just read-only but also allow for writing. The browser needs to know what to do
          to handle [[fetch]] verbs beyond <code>GET</code> and <code>HEAD</code> as well as <code>form</code>
          submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proposal</strong>. One simpler option is to start with read-only; anything else produces a 405
          error. A writable iteration could involve using <code>FetchEvent</code> to process arbitrary HTTP requests
          and gateway them to the underlying protocol. Alternatively, we may go straight to the latter if there is
          no specific concern with the approach.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Secure</h2>
        <p>
          We need to determine if schemes are secure (support more powerful APIs, are allowed as mixed content).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proposal</strong>. Extension-supported schemes are considered secure. Extensions are expected
          to make sure that they do not map to insecure protocols.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>CORS</h2>
        <p>
          Is the scheme subject to CORS gating?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proposal</strong>. Yes. It is easy enough for an extension to handle CORS handshakes itself
          according to its own preference.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Referrer</h2>
        <p>
          Does this scheme get sent as a referrer for loaded resources or navigations?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proposal</strong>. No. The strict CSP should prevent the loading of resources from content
          loaded in an extension-supported scheme, which would make a referrer moot. For navigation, the potential
          tracking risk is not worth the value.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Top-level frame</h2>
        <p>
          Is this scheme only for resources loaded from another context or can it be loaded at the top level?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proposal</strong>. It can be loaded at the top level.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
          Does the scheme support setting cookies, using local storage, etc. and if so according to which rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proposal</strong>. Extension-supported schemes do <em>not</em> support any of these mechanisms
          so as to avoid impacting privacy. However, the extension can expose a form of storage if desired.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>CSP</h2>
        <p>
          We need to integrate into the CSP model for security to work properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proposal</strong>. Default to a very strict CSP and don't allow the extension to override it. We can
          loosen things later if need be.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Other questions</h2>
        <p>
          More questions need to be answered. From Eric Lawrence's list:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How do navigations to these urls interact with all of the other WebNavigation/WebRequest extensibility APIs?</li>
          <li>Is this scheme allowed from Sandboxed frames?</li>
          <li>How does the scheme interact with the sandbox? What process isolation is used?</li>
          <li>Can such navigations only occur from trusted contexts or is JavaScript allowed to invoke such navigations?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also need to look more closely at the details of what browsers do (see Fabrice's notes about Gecko
          for instance).
